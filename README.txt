=== YOUR TASK ===

Write a solution for the 'getMatterData' API.

** You ONLY need to modify code in the file common/models/matter/getMatterData.js **

You will find a comment there --> //TODO: YOUR SOLUTION GOES HERE

GOAL: use the models provided to you on lines 27 - 31 so that the API responds like the sample output data in the file 'sample-output.json'

You can use http://localhost:3000/explorer/#!/Matter/Matter_getMatterData for testing and enter matterId 1000

=== NOTES ===

To run the server run:

node .

You can then access swagger here:

http://localhost:3000/explorer/
